# Rock-Paper-Scissor
This game has two versions:
1)Playing with the computer
2)Multiplayer Mode

We can play the rock paper scissor game either with the user or with your friend
I prefer mostly playing with the computer because in case of multiplayer mode you will need 
third person operator all your moves.
In this game all the rules which are  followed are the same as the original game.
This is a basic use of if-elif-else ladder in python.
Included even the modules concept of python, by creating an instructions module which contains all the instructions to play the game.
Imported the instructions module in the main file, which reduces the lenght of the code in the main file.
