# Rock-Paper-Scissor
This is a multiplayer python project to play the Rock,Paper,Scissor game.
In this game all the rules which are  followed are the same as the original game.
This is a basic use of if-elif-else ladder in python.
Included even the modules concept of python, by creating an instructions module which contains all the instructions to play the game.
Imported the instructions module in the main file, which reduces the lenght of the code in the main file.
